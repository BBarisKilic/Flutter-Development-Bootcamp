# I Am Poor
A simple Flutter project.

## Through this project, I've learned:
- to set up a new Flutter project using Android Studio.
- the Widget tree and to use pre-made Flutter Widgets for user interface design.
- to incorporate Image and Text Widgets to create simple user interfaces.
- to incorporate App Icons for iOS and Android.
- how to add and load image assets to Flutter projects.
- how to run Flutter apps on iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, and physical devices.
