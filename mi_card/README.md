# Mi Card
A personal business card as an app. The project has been written solely in Dart Language.

## Through this project, I've learned:
-	how to create Stateless Widgets.
-	what is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold.
-	how to use Containers to lay out your UI.
-	how to use Columns and Rows to position your UI elements.
-	how to add custom fonts.
-	how to add Material icons.
-	how to style Text widgets.
-	how to read and use Flutter Documentation.
